## Worked Examples in Python
# from _Data Science from Scratch_, by Joel Grus

This repo contains my retyped versions of the exercises and code provided in Joel Grus' _Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python_. I'm not making any claim about having modified the code in any meaningful way; my retyping the code is simply a way to help get the python syntax and code structure in my head.
